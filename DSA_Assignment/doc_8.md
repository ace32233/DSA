# Sorting Algorithms Performance (C)

A simple C program that:
- Generates **N random integers**
- Sorts them using **one selected algorithm per execution**
- Reports **comparisons** and **swaps/array movements**

## Algorithms Included
- Bubble Sort
- Selection Sort
- Insertion Sort
- Merge Sort

-**Note:** Only **one sorting algorithm** is chosen and executed each time the program runs.

## Features
- Random numbers range: **1 to 1000**
- Prints:
  - Full array if `N <= 100`
  - Otherwise prints **first 50** and **last 50** elements
- Tracks performance:
  - **Comparisons** for all algorithms
  - **Swaps** (Bubble / Selection / Insertion)
  - **Array movements** (Merge Sort)
